This repository contains my submissions for the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com) course by the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi).

The course introduces modern JavaScript-based web development, with main focus on building single page applications with ReactJS and REST APIs built with Node.js.

This repository follows the folder structure given as example from part0.
